### Time

Converts the provided number into a String listing the time (days, hours, minutes and seconds).

This placeholder provides variants to treat the number as a different time unit:

- `time_fromMilliseconds` / `time_fromMs` to treat the number as milliseconds.
- `time_fromSeconds` / `time_fromSecs` to treat the number as seconds (Default for `time` itself).
- `time_fromMinutes` / `time_fromMins` to treat the number as minutes.
- `time_fromHours` / `time_fromHrs` to treat the number as hours.
